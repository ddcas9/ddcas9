- 👋 Hi, I’m @ddcas9

- 👀 I’m interested in the neuroscience of learning, memory, and cognitive disorders, but right now I'm focusing on AI tools for histopathology, clinical and educational simulation/modeling and computational biology 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about simulation, dynamical systems, image processing, TensorFlow 2, bioconductor, and transcriptomics
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on EdTech, histopathology and clinical AI projects!
